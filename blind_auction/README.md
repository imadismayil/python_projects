# 🏆 Auction Program

This is a simple Python command-line program that simulates a blind auction. Users enter their names and bid amounts, and the program determines the highest bidder using three different methods.

## 📌 Features

- Accepts multiple user bids interactively
- Simulates screen-clearing between bids
- Determines the highest bid using:
  - Manual comparison logic
  - Python’s built-in `max()` function
  - `sorted()` with `reverse=True`
